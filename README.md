# Uber-Data-Analytics-End-To-End-Data-Engineering-Project
Using an Uber dataset, I will build a data model in fact and dimension format and write the transformation code in Python. This code will then be deployed on compute instance on Google Cloud, where Mage will be installed. We will then load our data onto big query which is in data warehouse and create our final dashboard.
