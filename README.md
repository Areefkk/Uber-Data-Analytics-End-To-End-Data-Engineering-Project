# Uber-Data-Analytics-End-To-End-Data-Engineering-Project
Using an Uber dataset, I will build a data model in fact and dimension format and write the transformation code in Python. This code will then be deployed on a compute instance on Google Cloud, where Mage will be installed. We will then load our data onto big query which is in data warehouse and create our final dashboard.
